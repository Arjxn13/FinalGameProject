# FinalGameProject

Description: My game features a player going around eliminating hostile enemy robots. It includes a boss battle at the end, slick graphics and immersive movement mechanics. Various secret rooms are also hidden
for the players to find in order to gain in-game perks.

Controls: WASD to move around, Space to jump, LMB to shoot, RMB to aim, E to consume / pickup items.

Script Changes: I took the script from my first microgame and added consumables for the player to find in new additional rooms that provide perks. Such as: more health, speed boost, or increased firerate. 

I am most proud of the powerups that I added into the game along with the new bigger map.

My biggest challenge while making this was formulating the code for the consumable power ups. Through youtube tutorials and chat-gpt, this was eventually conquered.
